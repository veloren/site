# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @YusufBeraErtan, @juliancoffee, @Isse, @imbris,
@zesterer, @Sam, @flo, @XVar, @DominikBroński, @Dong, @tygyh, @xMAC94x, @Sau,
and @zDrag0nG!

This week saw an unprecedented increase in player count. When the number of players came closer to the server limit of 400 the overall gaming experience became bad due the long reaction time. Thus this week was dominated by developers working to optimize the server code.

## @tormeh

A while back I added a modification to NPC behavior where NPCs with a certain
personality and above a certain health threshold would attack others if there
were no one else nearby (i.e. no witnesses)

## @floppy

We have been working on playable music instruments that allow players to combine their collected instruments into (hopefully) enjoyable sounds.

The guitar in the video uses samples, recorded by @Oolnokk, the model was
created by MerlinMan.
