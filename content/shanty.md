You ever wanted to be part of a team working together like we do at veloren by just singing? Become part of the Veloren-Shanty*-Choir! 

Since the 0.13 release will be sea-themed, we had the idea to record a Shanty, featuring all @Contributors (who we can motivate to sing). Over the cause of the last weeks a talented team of musicians has created lyrics, melody (Alto) and choir voices (Soprano, Tenor, Bass) for a song and I figured out how to create karaoke videos from there.

So please pick your favorite voice to play on headphones, read the lyrics on screen and sing along into your microphone. Record either all in one piece or per stanza (I preferred singing each stanza four times and then selected the one least out of tune/rhythm) and send the recordings to #deleted-channel.
Uncompressed (.wav or .flac) has best quality, but we would rather prefer a mobile phone recording by you over no contribution. If you prefer to cut your audio files before sending them, audacity is a good free option available for all systems.

@Gudrun (GMT+2)  has recorded all four stanzas (the last is identical to the first one) in Alto voice to give you an example to learn the rhythm – which is tricky at times. Of course we will record real instruments in parallel and @DaforLynx [GMT-7] will give it a good mixing. The end result will be surely great, become part of the promotion trailer and play in specific locations in game.
If you feel that professional music is too great of a challenge for you, bring yourself into the right mood by putting a Pirate’s hat and an eye patch on, imagine a hook on your arm and a saber at your side, sip on a themed beverage of your choice, …, then roar along with increased passion and confidence.

*) Take a look here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_shanty “A sea shanty is a genre of traditional folk song that was once commonly sung as a work song to accompany rhythmical labor aboard large merchant sailing vessels.”
Maybe the next time when stuck at coding, we should have an online conference ♫ to get into the flow 🛶.

Choose whichever one you like to learn your voice. All recordings must be sung along one of these to keep matching tune and rhythm. The recording should only include your own voice.
