The Veloren core developers condemn the aggressive and unprecedented invasion of
Ukraine and the violence committed toward its people on the orders of Vladimir
Putin. We also wish to make clear that Russian people continue to be welcome in
the Veloren community, as ever, and that we do not consider them in any way
accountable for the unaccountable and unforgivable actions of Vladimir Putin.

## Veloren 0.12 Dev Chats

For the 0.12 release, some of the core developers streamed another "dev chats".

## Veloren Mastodon

I created a Mastodon account for Veloren
([@veloren@mastodon.technology](https://mastodon.technology/@veloren)) to better
communicate with our FOSS friends. For those unfamiliar, Mastodon is an open
source decentralized microblogging platform. We will be posting updates there in
addition to our current use of Reddit and Twitter.

## Veloren GSoC

Veloren is applying for Google Summer of Code! Although we haven't been accepted
yet, we still have planned many areas where potential work on Veloren could
happen. To learn more, you can [read the blog
post](https://veloren.net/gsoc-contribution-guide/).
