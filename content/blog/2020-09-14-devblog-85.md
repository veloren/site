This week, we have a new art blog by @Pfau. @xMAC94x goes into detail on how we
measure networking statistics.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @xMAC94, @Sharp, @tylerlowrey, @Imbris,
@Slipped, @TheThirdSpartan, and @mttmartin42!

@Pfau is back at the Veloren art blogs! You can check out [No. 7
here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/art-blog-no-7-41635011). @Capucho is still
trudging through the magic that in WGPU. @Awkor has been doing work on an
inventory autosort proof of concept. @James is Working on new hotbar skill for
the axe and a new m2 for the hammer (moving current m2 to the hotbar). @Sam is
working on a sword overhaul.

@Songtronix wrote a discord bot (@Veloren) to control his testing server. It
includes:

- Switching branches easily
- Querying the status of the server (updating, compiling) at any time
- Downloading the database
- Viewing server settings

## Improved Server Metrics To Improve Server Performance by @xMAC94x

The first step of optimizing Veloren's server code is to know what runs the
slowest. If we were to optimize less impactful areas, they wouldn't impact the
end-user as much. We are using Prometheus metrics to gather data in real-time
from our main server.

With some recent additions, we are now able to get the following metrics:

- **Chunks requested from the server**: every time a client asks for a chunk we
  will see how the server reacts. We can see if it need to compute the chunk or
  if it can just send a chunk which is already loaded because another player is
  already there.
- **Chunk generation**: when a chunk needs to be generated it is queued. This
  metrics will help us to see if this queue is getting bigger over time or if it
  remains at a healthy size.
- **Active players**: players online is now split into players connected and
  disconnected. This makes it easy to detect single events and even lets us
  detect when a client joins in the same time other leaves. The online players
  will be calculated with the difference. For disconnect, we now also track the
  event (i.e. Gracefully Close, Timeout, Network error). Though currently, under
  some conditions a network error is thrown for what is actually a graceful
  close.
- **State timings**: Even deeper look at our engine's `State` timings. Before we
  only had a total time for our entire state. Now we can get the state timings
  based on each subsystem. It shows that physics likely needs the next
  optimisation.

### Theory Of Continuous Prometheus Metrics

Metrics are generated every tick, but are actually only polled by the Prometheus
server every 2 seconds. This means we only get a metric for every 60th tick.
There are now multiple ways to handle this, especially in relation to timing
data. Until now, we have always exported the last tick's timing. This meant we
got 100% accurate timings on 1 out of 60 ticks, and no timing information on the
remaining 59 ticks. We just had to assume that all the other 59 ticks are
probably the same as this one tick. But we have no way of knowing if the tick we
received was part of the 95th percentile, meaning much faster or slower than the
rest. This information is important, as super slow ticks are the ones that cause
lag.

Another way to tackle this problem is by summing up the timings. We can still
poll the data every 2 seconds (60 ticks). So we get the total time spend for our
all of these ticks, but aggregated together. However, just take the average and
assume each tick was just 1/60 of that value. Or if there is a slow tick and 59
fast ticks, there is no way of knowing.

}}

For this case, Prometheus has histograms. They provide buckets for different
time ranges, lets say <1ms, 1-5ms, 5-10ms, >10ms. With Histograms, each tick
will increase a number in its corresponding bucket. So if we have a super fast
tick, it will increase the number in the <1ms bucket. if we have a super slow
tick we increase the number in >10ms. We will be using a combination of BOTH.
summing up all ticks AND histograms in the future to detect the average time we
spend in a certain part of our code as well as make sure, that we don't have any
spikes causing lags.

Altogether, these new techniques will allow us to get much better telemetry
about the outliers. Often it's hard to make networking work well purely from
what seems to be best in theory. Veloren's application is unique in many ways,
and so we will have to keep striving to analyze how it runs from the data.
