If you want to get a glimpse into the difficulties and debugging aids to implement tracks you can take a look into [these series of posts in #rendering](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/467073814208053248/1039222013312639056).

### instrument crafting

@Pfau started a [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/1036737546954211449/1036737550150291517) about instrument crafting and received a lot of feedback.

### Savannah pits

The merge of the savannah pits, a new town type, got lost during the pre-Halloween preparations,
now with some minor fixes merged this week we feature a picture from within this town type:

### Roshwalr attacks by @Ythern

@Ythern continued their work on giving the Roshwalr a specific attack capability

{{ video(src="https://s3.eu-central-2.wasabisys.com/veloren-blog/cdn/1040257157926498396/1041453594718785596/2022-11-13_21-44-07.mp4") }}

which then lead to an interesting discussion about the animation building up the attack and a reworked proposal by @floppy

and the subsequent reviews to get it merged.
