## Contributor Work

Thanks to last three weeks' contributors @fnetX and @juliancoffee, @gamer-kold, @fvasco, @xvar, @ThomasS, @Isse and @Christof, @uniior, @Hrom and @crabman,
@xMAC94x, @walpo, @zesterer, @Synis, @Treeco, and @KayHemme.

The merged work includes many updated translations, an updated Nix flake, a database index optimization, more specific NPC dialogs,
loading plugins from the server, spots in plugins, removing pillars from Sahagin and Myrmidon dungeons, loot table balancing,
a web UI for the server, ChangeLog spelling fixes, revised cacti, roll balancing, dependency updates, revised general skills, CI caching,
shader improvements (cloud, horizon, LoD), cave biome updates, many new LoD models, friendly fire and PvP auras in desert city arenas,
label adjustments in trade dialog, a new single-player world, and finally the 0.16 release.

Ongoing (unmerged) work is happening on terracotta boss tweaks, NPCs in plugins, test server fixes, sprite attributes, friend lists, loot exporting,
fluid dynamics, ore damage counting, durability tweaks, attack AI fixes, a Rodio update, more efficient network encoding, a new Veloren logo,
a new UI technology, and spawning voxel models.
