This week, we hear about loadouts and livestreams that @JulianCoffee has been
doing.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Sam, @xMAC94x, @Anton, @Leonic, @Plright,
@Vlad, @aflyingpumpkin, and @flo!

A new Veloren Reading Club is out, this time with @imbris! This week, we
explored Veloren's graphics pipeline. We worked on refactoring particles, and
how they re-create their buffer every frame.

### Livestreams and loadouts by @JulianCoffee

So, this MR happens to be my 100th. And to make it more special, I wanted to
make [a live coding
playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaf5k0VHJogKIWxTidcDvMqEcrxuIUzq5)
of me making it and trying to explain what I am doing. It mostly covers handling
errors in Rust, a bit about traits, and type conversions via From/Into traits.
For Veloren it is mostly concentrated on our assets system and Serde (library
for serialisation and de-serialisation). I wanted to record full work and
mention review process, but then war happened, so sorry for the incomplete
playlist.

As for what has changed, we can now create the following loadout config.

```rs
##![enable(implicit_some)]
(
    inherit: Combine([
        Asset("test.loadout.ok.just_crafted_rings"),
        Choice([
            (1, Asset("test.loadout.ok.just_ori_armor")),
            (1, Asset("test.loadout.ok.just_dragonscale")),
        ]),
        Asset("test.loadout.ok.just_butterfly_gliders"),
        Asset("test.loadout.ok.just_lanterns"),
    ]),
    active_hands: [
        (1, (
            "common.items.weapons.sword.caladbolg",
            None,
        )),
        (1, (
            "common.items.weapons.bow.sagitta",
            None,
        )),
        (1, (
            "common.items.weapons.hammer_1h.orichalcum-0",
            "common.items.weapons.hammer_1h.orichalcum-0",
        )),
        (1, (
            "common.items.weapons.axe_1h.orichalcum-0",
            "common.items.weapons.shield.shield_1",
        )),
    ],
)
```

The most notable thing is inheriting, yes, you can now reuse available loadouts
in other loadouts. Also, the way of handling weapons is improved, as you can see
we can have paired weapons or just one two-handed weapon. (Pirates that can
switch between paired swords and bows when?) And there is more!

If you have any questions, feel free to ping me on the Veloren Discord!
