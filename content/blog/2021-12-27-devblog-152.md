This week, we hear about some updates to the item displays. The Christmas
holiday event is coming to a close.

@Christof is also working on skiing, which is not yet ready as physics and
animations aren't finished. Hopefully, we can hit the slopes in 2022!

@DaForLynx, @Oolnokk, and @Rarnage have been working on adding new music to the
game. Expect some more variety.

## Item Displays by @DoctorKompot

This week, I updated the item displays! All the items that were still using old
PNG files to display in the inventory have been updated to `.vox` models, which
look a lot better. Credits to @Gemu for the awesome art.

I also updated the item quality backgrounds, making them lighter, as it was
pretty hard to tell what item you were looking at sometimes.

Other changes:

- Phoenix Feather is now Legendary quality
- Yeti loot table has been tweaked by @UncomfySilence (*The Polaris lantern and
  Boreal Warhelm are no longer dropped by the wild Christmas Yeti*)
- @Pfau's Turban hat has been worked on to better fit the head of characters
