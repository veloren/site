## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @XVar, @aweinstock, @xMAC94x, @tygyh,
@imbris, @Treeco, @Capucho, @Sam, and @James!

Veloren is running an [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)
leaderboard! Advent of Code is a programming challenge that takes place in the
first 25 days of December every year. Every day at 00:00 EST, a new challenge is
released. If you want to join the Veloren leaderboard, stop by the
`##advent-of-code` channel on Discord to get the code!

This week, @Pfau and @Sam have been working on adding ability selection.

There have also been ongoing experiments with the new site system, which has
been attracting a lot of attention since the first Veloren Reading Club. Below,
we can see some trials done by @James.

layers of worldgen are set up.
