The merged work includes more beginner balancing, shaderc optimization fixes, attack blocking,
terracotta tweaks, glider buffs, sword vs speed buff balancing, more sword balancing,
translation updates, cave updates ðŸ’Ž, more flexible asset autocompletion,
a bunch of Weblate translations, generating worlds from the command line, body transformation,
translation fixes, enemy balancing in terracotta ruins, lots of translation enhancements,
chat window updates, glider fixes, gliding travelers, admin broom improvements,
beam aiming fixes, dependency vulnerability fixes, loot table simplifications,
dropped item merge, better character loading debugging, admin glider, and pets for NPCs.

Ongoing (unmerged) work is happening on learnable recipes, vampire castle, spots in plugins,
loading plugins from the server, quadtree LoD tiling, animated NPCs in plugins, attack balancing,
bitcode for more efficient network communication, dwarfen mines, NIX script updates, sword animation,
structure data loading, sprite attributes, a new voxygen UI, hammer skills, mage tower,
attack radius, further cave changes, `aabb_in_circle` refactoring, rock snapper animation,
test server fixes, inventory overflow, aerodynamics, loot table in structure rework,
loot table balancing, merging torvus and more Weblate translation updates.

Phew, there is a lot of coding going on at the moment!

## Tweaks, fixes and additions to air content by @juliancoffee

### Glider physics
So, remember the update to the glider which left some people upset? Well, sorry, although we did buff it later, so I guess it's fine now :). But I'm here to announce a new change, more like a bugfix, to be honest.

Two things:

* Actual wind.
    We missed it in the client-side calculation of gliding, this update enables it, and it's much cooler now.
    Your gliding ratios will naturally be affected by it, if you fly into the wind, your horizontal velocity will be lower, while vertical one is the same, which means you will cover less distance until you touch the ground.

    But the same is true if you follow the wind, in that case, your velocity is buffed by it, which means you can cover more distance until you touch the ground!
    Whether the wind goes where you want to go or not might be the question of luck, yes, so ... I wish you all good luck!)
* Ridge lift.
    Here @Treeco might add more (he was responsible for fix in this MR), but conceptually, the more steep the terrain is, the bigger lift you get, because the wind pushes into the ground and bounces from it. If it pushes into the mountains, the only way it can go then is upward, so you get a massive boost there. Here is the video during the strong storm. (Note, air velocity and actual upward gliding velocity).

### NPC Gliding AI

For a while, humanoid NPC with gliders did equip the glider when reaching the velocity limit soon after which they would receive fall damage, but the way they controlled their glider was wrong, and they did stall very frequently. Now, this problem is fixed, as they are using their glider maybe even better than Voxygen's automatic glide feature.

### Admin tools

For a while, we had The Broom in /kit debug, it resembles the legends of witches using them to fly, but the actual implementation and visuals were close to non-existent. So I did improve things a little, by adding better particles and orientation. There's an intermediate state shown in the video below, and since then we have improved things to change orientation based on velocity (so now the animation also changes depending on whether you fly up or down) and better particle positioning, which can be seen if you try to fly straight down.

And, for a long time, I was working on Admin Glider. The goal was revamping internal ability systems, as for now we only can have them on weapons, which is limiting, we want to do more. Also, it's a chance to experiment with the glider itself and explore different gliding physics effects.
Here is a very short demo.

Here is the recorded video:

In the future it allows us to be more flexible with where our abilities come from, so we can implement things like fishing, better mining, armor abilities, fist fighting and so on.

Comments by @Treeco:

So, ridge lift isn't a new feature, and in fact we've made it weaker than before, but previously it applied in the wrong places.

It's meant to represent horizontal wind being deflected upwards by hillsides, generating updraughts, however we were calculating steepness incorrectly, such that plains were maximally steep, and a sheer cliff faces were considered horizontal. This lead to unexpected, random, strong thermals while travelling, and was generally just confusing. It seems to work more as expected now.

## Animated characters in plugins by @Christof

This figure has a separate idle and running animation

I have a working animation inside a plugin, connected via [WIT](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) (so I could also write the animation in C++, java script or python), hot reloading for plugins isn't working, yet, but it is already very cool!

[Plugin source code](https://gitlab.com/veloren/dev/veloren/-/blob/christof/plugin_figure/plugin/examples/anim/src/lib.rs?ref_type=heads#L60)

And these are the most amazing features of all:

* you can compile the plugin with only a copy of the wit, no veloren sources are required
* you can debug the plugin in chrome, single step into Rust independent of veloren:

```JavaScript
import {animation, events} from './anim.js'
import {getBody} from './veloren/plugin/actions.js'

events.load('single-player');
let bodyidx = getBody("lizard");
let body = new animation.Body(bodyidx);
let dependency = {
    velocity: [1.0, 2.0, 0.0],
    ori: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
    lastOri: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
    globalTime: 0.2,
    avgVel: [1.0, 2.0, 0.0],
    state: 'run',
};
let skeleton = body.updateSkeleton(dependency, 0.1);
console.log(skeleton);
```
