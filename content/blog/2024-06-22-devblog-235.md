These weeks, we muse about conflict resolution.

\- Christof, TWiV editor

## Contributor Work

## Development discussions

There seems to be some unfortunate TLS QUIC interaction reported by
@HostEZ.io, see [this thread](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/1248917700776820827/1248917706149728296) for more details.

The learnable recipes now have a [Wiki page](https://wiki.veloren.net/wiki/Recipes) detailing what each scroll unlocks and where to obtain it.

@xMAC94x resumed the work on partial downloads, see [this thread](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/1249833646303612948/1249835413972193423) and [this older thread](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/956026926936490014/956644870607495228) for more details.

## Disagreement and conflict resolution

Several long term developers got into an argument with each other in a discussion about instruments and sounds.
This spiraled into misunderstanding, misattribution and hurt feelings.

The repercussions of this conflict lead to some soul-searching among the developers and moderators. During this
many day process the following statements were created to summarize the consensus reached:

### Helpful tips and things to know for contributors

① Team leads have veto power. Typically, we work so all contributions can be merged in some state if the original contributor is willing to work
with team leads and other contributors. Don't take it personally if a team lead vetos your idea. If you are willing to compromise, open a dialogue
and work together towards a better Veloren.

➁ Some community members have a tendency to comment on anything and everything without context or investigation.
This isn't helpful and generates lots of less than useful feedback. Often this is paired with strong opinions that could use some softening.
It is important to remember that not all feedback needs to be acted on. However, it is also important not to completely ignore people,
especially when they are trying to be helpful.

➂ The existence of community feedback and the behavior mentioned in ➁ requires contributors to be able to sift through feedback for
what may actually be helpful and ignore the rest. This requires being able to tolerate some degree of unhelpful feedback.

➃ Veloren is a community project open to all kinds of people. This practically guarantees that some people will not act how any given individual wants them to.
As a contributor one has to learn how to resolve conflicts. It is one of the many challenges expected when working with a diverse, global team.
We believe the benefits of working together far outweigh the challenges.

➄ If someone in the community has a problem with specific actions from specific individuals, they need to report it.
It is unfair to the admin and moderation team to expect grievances to be addressed if they are never described and reported.
That said, we always strive to keep people invested in our community and would rather use teachable moments to better all of our interactions than ban people.
