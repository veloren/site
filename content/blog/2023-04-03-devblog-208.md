These weeks, we get to select a spawn location.

\- Christof, TWiV Contributor

## Contributor Work

Thanks to last three weeks' contributors, @imbris, @DuckLuck, @floppy, @christof, @zesterer, @Sam, @Pfau, @ProfessionalHobbyist, @yusdacra, @kinoshi, @tygyh, @Isse, and @Maxicarlos08.

These changes include the new sword skill tree, an April's fool surprise, configurable day length, RON based spots, time synchronization, translations and the selection of the starting town.

Ongoing (unmerged) work is happening on rtsim2, Adlet dungeons, Durability (aka death penalty), multi-loot and the optimization branch "zoomy worldgen".

## Work on learnable recipes by @James

I've been working on crafting recipes. With my changes recipes can now be learned. Pfau and Gemu are working on the art side

## Selectable Spawn location by @zesterer

I'm working on allowing new players to choose their spawn location. The UI is still quite rough and @Pfau [GMT +2] will probably force me to clean it up before merge, but it does at least work. In the long term, I'd like this to grow into a system that allows you to choose your character's backstory and attributes more like a traditional RPG.

(Yes, that is a temporary slider, I have no intention of forcing players to move a slider to choose their site)

And here's the final result:

## Rtsim2 work

@zesterer and @Isse are working on bringing the new simulation ready, this involves a lot of different professions in towns, more meaningful behavior of NPCs and persistent resource exhaustion.

## Multi-model voxel files

@Christof is working on loading multiple models from one voxel file, this should make coherent design of armor sets more easy.

## Adlet animations

@floppy, @Gemu and @Sam are tirelessly working on making the Adlet dungeon a remarkable place
