These weeks, we show images of how snow and illuminations transformed the
world of Veloren into a winter wonderland for ten days, read a travel report
and peek into the ongoing Haniwa tomb work.

## Meanwhile on the party map

Because the party map was hand-designed by @Hannibal and not procedurally generated it isn't covered in snow.
But it still looks pretty enough to regularly become popular for photo shootings.

## Travel report by @Dodge

the very first day in veloren i got some leather armour and headed into eleokvan

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192068277057372172/image.png")}}

regretted so bad<br>
i was so unprepared

died so many times to sand sharks<br>
raptors<br>
but funny enough i killed a aracheos in eleokvan w the help of villages<br>
went to moskh to meet some new friends and since i knew i was so unprepared i went back to wreau

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192068683925823558/image.png")}}

after which i asked people in the chat to suggest me a town where i could start to journey<br>
people mentioned ornerd<br>
but well haha ornerd was already very less populated by merchants and villagers and looked like it went so much<br>
i decided its not enough and yea i killed just two hunters two merchants and two travellers with help from Rai<br>
and emotional support via flute performance by atenea<br>
then i headed for the south areas<br>
so i went to some high up places in the mountains to take in the view

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192069976035709029/image.png")}}

and flew down to alaubrord wasnt too much interested in it<br>
then went to spolm

pretty normal village as wel<br>
the nicest part was climbing the mountain and looking at the world<br>
and gliding down back<br>
Bolvarr was also pretty much like other villages<br>
then i got some advice that i need to find pincers in order to make good frostwood weapons from froggy and horblegorble<br>
so i went out to search for crabs<br>
this is where the real journey began

someone mentioned there were a lot of crabs near the central lake so i set out to bichriel

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192070816880394281/image.png")}}

i was scared of antlions<br>
or i couldve hunted them and the spiders instead so i was like<br>
i already killed some crabs and got pincers and they were pretty easy to kill<br>
so uhh yea but good news is i didnt kill more than 5 crabs perhaps<br>
got most of it from merchants<br>
:)<br>
so yea back to the story , someone mentioned again that its near the desert area so i set out to that side and somehow ended up walking along to the savannah lands<br>
saw my first ever savannah village mpizozi<br>
i thought it was like any other village but oh boy<br>
the tunnel system was SO COOL<br>
like so many rooms connected via tunnels<br>
so so cool üëç<br>
then i was like why not journey to every town and find it out? so i set out to go to every town in this map!

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192072072470474833/image.png")}}

most of the villages werent that interesting but i totally enjoyed abelen, it had such good atmosphere<br>
gotta say one of my fav villages is abelen shoutout to abelen!<br>
and i reached valing, by that time i knew this one is going to be a long journey this map is VAST as hell<br>
this is the final screenshot of the early days part, where i started from valing and ended at ordodraic

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192072539623657512/image.png")}}

again nginsu was a savannah village and the other villages were like wreau but the most interesting one of all is ordodraic<br>
i will never forget how deserted that village was<br>
not a single soul<br>
even Ayialrad which was also cut off and didnt have any sort of transportation routes had a lot of people<br>
but this village was suuuper deserted

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1190496320759279697/image.png")}}

this was the path i took yesterday<br>
left ordodraic to asaundling and passed on a few villages to finally meet bakhyen mountain folk<br>
the mountain people have such a cool town<br>
and there was a mine near bakhyen which had steepy caves<br>
so was very easy to escape and use arrows and mine well<br>
was a fruitful mining session over 21 iron ingots, 3 diamonds 5 amethyst 5 emeralds and 2 cobalt ores<br>
and cute fungomes

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1190497303971233945/image.png")}}

this is the path i took today<br>
the first village was a normal savannah village nothing too extraordinary<br>
but after that i went to see town ereris which is uh no town actually<br>
got washed up by the lake/river sadly<br>
the circle with the number one is ereris <br>
the circle with number 2 is a mountain village called Ayialrad and surprisingly even if it has no means of transport has a lot of merchants and guards, was surprised that ordodraic, even if it had proper roads and proper houses had no people but this village had<br>
finally climbed up a mountain and glided down to Dunbapa, pretty cool day

went on a deep mining session and got dripped

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1190948773397016686/image.png")}}

climbed the tree of yest!

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191025540069605487/image.png")}}

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191036771564257401/image.png")}}

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191332571380977674/image.png")}}

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191332876428521472/image.png")}}

ended the day with ston<br>
and today<br>

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191333201403195422/image.png")}}

met my new friend driggle at fobreric<br>
i skipped that village on the northeast of crathos cuz rai said it was submerged as well<br>
and ston had only one house lol<br>
very bizzarre yet cool<br>
the journey is almost coming to a close<br>
idk if indiana jones is here but im going to your fav town next ;)

this is the ideal village

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191606114463256586/image.png")}}

just the center workstation<br>
nothing else

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191613561647136788/image.png")}}

reached my last village that i had to travel<br>
storic<br>
:)<br>
successfully completed the voyage

came back to wreau in new drip :D

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1191660871164907590/image.png")}}

So this is how my final day of journey went<br>
started from crathos

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192066011759911012/image.png")}}

went to adrespilling

Indiana jones's fav town<br>
it was a nice beachside town<br>
pretty scenery<br>
Frilling is just another village you see

and on the way i went to ostechrendam<br>
the most ideal village<br>
after which there was two towns that i havent went<br>
one was storic and the other was lamakan<br>
so i went thru abelen and the villages that i visited way earlier

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192067005579280404/image.png")}}

i really love how beautiful abelen is<br>
totally recommend doing a visit to the town<br>
could say its a better ornerd simply because you wouldnt find a frost giga suddenly spawning in there xD<br>
finally reached storic by gliding down the mountains<br>
with a melanchoclic music by the side<br>
the song name was "the heavens weep"<br>
thanks to nolan i completed the journey by airshipping to lamakan, why? well i wanted to try airship once in this journey

{{img(src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523568428905398283/1192067892716507156/image.png")}}

and went to mine in a nearby cave that necti mentioned, and it had a lot of bloodsteel, mined with nolan got good amount of bloodsteel went to eleokvan, got my armour headed to wreau and ended my journey for the day<br>
:D

that marks the end of the grand journey<br>
thanks for tagging along :)

also forgot to mention<br>
while i was trying to go to adrespilling i was chased down by sea clerics -_-

[¬π]: feat Rai (The Wyvern Slayer), they accompanied me for that short journey in their airship

## Ongoing Haniwa tomb work

@Floppy is working on a tomb inspired by structures close to the Great Wall, the screenshots are just
too exciting to withhold.
The original site design was done by @Hannibal in MagicaVoxel, @Gemu created new models.
