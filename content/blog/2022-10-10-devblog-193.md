### Halloween planning

The veloren team plans to have a Halloween themed week directly before November ends.

Collected Ideas include werewolves, flying bats, spooky lanterns, pumpkins, villagers in costumes, candy drops,
"trick or treat" interactions, flying with a broom, a more spooky moon color, acid rain.

### Ongoing work

#### Bridges (Isse)

@Isse has been doing some worldgen work on larger bridges, and can span larger gaps.
They are inspired by larger-architected bridges. There is work that does checks at
generation time to make sure that the bridges flow nicely into the terrain.

There are several different types of bridges, some with the ability to bridge high
and low terrain with a tower and stairs to help players get to different heights.
Another bridge variant is small, and allows for roads to cross small rivers.
Once the bridges are ready, you’ll be able to see them on the minimap as well!

These different variants are inspired from medieval bridges in different cultures,
as well as different architectural patterns. Prototype models were created by @Hannibal,
and then remade with CSG objects by @Isse.

#### Plugin work (Socksonme and Christof)

@Christof and @Socksonme have been working on updating @zesterer’s plugins branch
to the current head of master.
@Christof has been planning some dug-out canoes to see how it can be made with the plugin system.

#### Water work (Zesterer)

Zesterer has worked on water shaders. Implemented moving water, screen space reflection,
and in general improving water shaders. Although much of this is experimental,
the techniques add a lot to how water looks in lakes and rivers.
