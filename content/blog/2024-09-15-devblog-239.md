These weeks, we share beautiful monster photos.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to last three weeks' contributors @coffee-compiler, @xMAC94x, and @a1phyr, @james, @isse, @do-no-van, @horblegorble, .

The merged work includes marking `Plain` messages explicitly,
renaming `spellbook` to `diary`, proper `ring` initialization and
an assets manager update, a bag vs exit dialog fix, a critical quinn update,
better recipe tooltips, Hydra üê≤üê≤üê≤, permadeath character option,
more detailed potion descriptions, and translation updates.

Ongoing (unmerged) work is happening on figures in plugins, bow rework,
stopping beams at terrain, moon phases, farming,
entity to terrain tethers (grappling hook), gamepad bindings,
a sewer styled dungeon, glider loops, improved climbing, hired NPCs in groups
and vampire castle.

## Translation work

Translators included in [MR 4575](https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren/-/merge_requests/4575):
@coffee-compiler, @evgenkot, @fnetX, @Furrior, @GGTheTranslator, @hurzelchen, @Javier P√©rez,
@Jungso, @Karaya, @LagerJack, @lucius_pilgrim, @Paw, @perospirone, @polauf, @Sinari,
@Sovenok-Hacker, and @2b33rs.

Thanks to the translators, as well as to @fnetX for again compiling this lists of contributors.

## Development discussions

@James created more informative tooltips on recipes: {{img(src="https://s3.eu-central-2.wasabisys.com/veloren-blog/cdn/239/2024-09-08-151226_273x236_scrot.png")}}

Also @James uploaded a nice video of flying a glider course
{{video(src="https://s3.eu-central-2.wasabisys.com/veloren-blog/cdn/239/course2_compressed.webm")}}

There is ongoing discussion in admin channels on how to cut down the number of trading bots spamming the chat. The motivation is to
avoid the impression to newly joining players that NPCs in the world act weird.

@DungeonLord [revived the farming land around towns](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/851517587337773056/1279524018478907463). See some nice pictures:

End of August the [new airshipper deleted screen shots](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/1279422925988036638/1279422931801210973) at start and upgrade, as these images were
stored in the game folder. This is now fixed again.

@Synis is continuing the work on a sewer themed dungeon. @khannibal already created some prototypes
thirty months ago:

@unii found that sword animations [get more complex when combined with moving](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/450065020878061600/1280655735033954346).

@Supa and @khannibal talked [barns and cathedral design](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/450039871650660374/1283971671447044117) and shared interesting concepts.

@xMAX94x found an [old Veloren 0.1 binary](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/523568428905398283/1284956906544300032) which is still operational:

Last but not least we got plenty of Hydra star photos:

## Airshipper call for testing

Announced on Sep 10th by @xMAC94x:

Hey folks, anyone here that wants to test the new windows-"an update is available from gitlab"-feature ?

Steps:

- Download [airshipper.exe](https://gitlab.com/veloren/airshipper/-/jobs/7786807218/artifacts/browse)
- This airshipper.exe when started should detect that there is a new update available.
- If you click install you should be able to successfully install airshipper 0.13.0.
- Next time you start (the system installed) airshipper, the 0.13.0 should run.

{{img(src="https://s3.eu-central-2.wasabisys.com/veloren-blog/cdn/239/screenshot_1726001128599.png")}}

Note:

- Windows only (Linux and MacOS dont have this feature, don't need tests)
- The provided download ALWAYS thinks there is a new update, that's not a bug, it's a feature to test this (the final version will not have this behavior and only update when there is a newer version).
- It might make sense to install an older Airshipper from [github](https://github.com/veloren/Airshipper/releases) to verify that the install update, really installs 0.13.0
