## Christmas Week 2021

It's the Christmas season, and we've made some special changes exclusive to this
week!

We'll be having a Christmas Party at 18:00 GMT on December 25th on the official
server. We know that many folks are separated from friends and family this year
due to Coronavirus, so feel free to log on if you're looking for some company.
