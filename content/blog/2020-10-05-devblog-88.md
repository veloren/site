This week, we get a deep dive into the modelling process by @Gemu. A new edition
of This Month in Rust Gamedev is out.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @xMAC94x, @XVar, @Sam, @pablosoler, @Pfau,
and @Sharp!

The September edition of "This Month in Rust Gamedev" is out! Check it out
[here](https://rust-gamedev.github.io/posts/newsletter-014/). @XVar has been
working on inventory slot upgrades which will allow players to obtain and craft
items that increase their number of inventory slots. @Pfau has been helping out
with the UI for this.

## Gemu

Hello! Gemu here from the assets & visual design team. I'm responsible for the
majority of Veloren’s creature models so far. Even though I have no experience
animating and coding, the modelling itself is more of my jam. The rest is done
by other wonderful contributors such as @Snowram and @Slipped. In this section,
I'll explain a bit about this process.

One important part of voxel modeling is the style you’re setting. Veloren has a
semi-realistic style, while being slightly stylistic. Because of this, it’s
fairly straightforward modeling non-fictional animals. When modelling animals,
references are very important. Using references, modelling the animal is all
about making directly what you see, rather than making what you know by heart.

To make the model stand out, recognising the unique traits of the animal and
stressing those parts in the model will make the animal model stand out more,
especially within the stylized limitations of voxels.

For fictional animals, there is no "correct" reference. Which means there’s an
entire world of possibilities for these creatures! Aside from creating your
entirely made-up creature, there are of course famous fantastical creatures that
everyone likes to see. This includes dragons, trolls, golems, you name it.

What’s most fun about modeling these is that you have to find the balance
between recognisability and own interpretation. This can be done using the same
method as for making real animals, by pinpointing their more characteristic
property and experimenting on that aspect. A golem, being a man-made construct
of stone, could look like a typical man-made stone structure such as a castle,
for instance. From that point, it basically comes down to trial and error, until
the model comes out close to what I had envisioned.

For the model to be functional, it is of course important that it fits the body
rigging animations within the game, or the “skeletons” so to speak. There are
various skeletons, such as that of various quadrupeds of various sizes, or
bipedal creatures, for instance. While modeling, it’s important that the various
individual body parts will fit corresponding ‘bones’ within the skeleton, to
make the animation work.

Sticking to these separate bones, I model every body part individually, then
piece them together to see if they fit well together. It’s good to keep in mind
that for a quadruped to look good while running, there has to be enough space
between the front and back legs, for instance.

As the creature will move and bend its body, body parts need proper attachment
points to one another. If the attachment points between body parts are solely
flat surfaces, jarring gaps might appear whenever the creature moves.

However, trial and error is prevalent within this branch as well, as we
continuously find newer and cooler ways to animate the animals. Seeing the
models come to life within the world of Veloren has been an amazing experience
so far.
