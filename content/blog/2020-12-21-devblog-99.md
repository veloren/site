This week we see new models coming into the game. We hear from @Christof about
how economic simulation is being done for different items.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Slipped, @XVar, @lboklin, @BenoitduGarreau,
@imbris, @Frinsky, @Entropy, @xMAC94x, @jiminiycrick, @zesterer, @ccgauche,
@Pfau, and @HiggsTardigradeTau!

This week, @Pfau posted another edition of his Veloren art blog, you can check
it out [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/blog-no-10-45215779). @ccgauche has
been putting in a lot of work into procedurally generated trees. They are also
working on the new backend of the plugin API.

@AlbinoAxolotl made serpent carnyx and brass boumbek models. @Scott worked on
some bigger updates to the wiki. @Sam got the axe skill tree finished up. @XVar
has the inventory/loadout overhaul nearing completion. The UI changes can be
seen in @Pfau art blog. @Sarra_Kitty worked on several new glider variants and
learned how to use Git for the first time. @Slipped animated stuns and staggers
for the poise system that @James implemented. Next, @Slipped will be moving on
to making the system fun to use.

## Economic Simulation by @Christof

[Last week](https://veloren.net/devblog-98#economic-simulation-update-by-christof), we
saw that prices are determined by supply and demand. But if you happen to be an
adventurer coming back from a dungeon where you risked your life to loot better
weapons and armor, you'll also end up with some less potent spare items in your
inventory and want to exchange them for new food and potions.

Typically there are two solutions to this within a program:

- Handcrafted, neatly balanced hardcoded prices (with some spatial or temporal
  variation)
- Economy simulations

Depending on the situation, the first shows a tendency to either feel too random
or too fixed. On the other hand, getting a simulation that works well enough is
a considerable piece of work. A core question that emerges is; why would a
person living a happy life in a town that farms crops ever want to exchange your
spare armor and weapons for their food, as only food offers a direct value to
feed the family?

This question has left me puzzled for some time as I wanted to find a way to
determine an exchange rate between armor and food to create reasonable prices
for trade. In June, @zesterer created the second generation of economic
simulation ([see TWiV-72](https://veloren.net/devblog-72/)) which calculated the
need for different professions among a town’s population and the exchange rates
between sites. But an exchange price for wheat and meat does not suit
adventurers that well as they will hardly be able to provide these goods in
exchange.

The idea I followed to get prices for martial equipment is to restrict access to
natural resources by a concept of a controlled area. The more area a town
controls the more natural resources it has access to. Subsequently, the more
secondary and tertiary goods it can produce, the more mouths can be fed. With
this in mind, we can get some exchange rate between armor and food, as one
controls the available amount of the other. The current production chart of this
model looks as follows:

}}

Rectangles show professions, ellipses show goods. Natural resources (which are
collected from surrounding areas) are colored in green, produced goods in
orange. The numbers indicate the number of goods needed and produced by a single
person. There are two special nodes at the bottom: “Everyone” literally means
any inhabitant of a town and “controlled area” corresponds to patches on the map
allocated in radial order by the amount of guards employed. So each town will
have its own pattern of surrounding natural resources, depending on its location
in the world.

An economic simulation step (see `tick_site_economy`) looks like this:

- `demand` is the sum of the goods (including food) needed by all the workers
  (and non-working people)
- `supply` is the sum of produced goods (taking last step’s availability of
  resources into account)
- `marginal_surplus` is supply - demand (indicates whether stock is increasing
  of decreasing)
- `surplus` is stock + `marginal_surplus` (the amount of missing (negative) or
  unneeded (positive) goods)
- relative good `value` is a smoothed exponential function of the relative
  amount of missing resources
- `labor` is redistributed according to the smoothed sum of the value of the
  produced goods
- `labor_productivity` is the minimum of the relative availability of resources
  from (last step’s) stock
- `materials_cost` is the sum of (last step’s) `labor_value` of the resources
  consumed, per produced unit
- `labor_values` is the sum of materials cost and wage cost (fixed 1.0 per
  worker), per unit

As the last step, some of the stock decays and is then replenished by naturally
grown resources. The population is easily simulated by a death rate of 0.5% and,
only if there is enough food to feed the inhabitants, a natural birth rate of
5%.
