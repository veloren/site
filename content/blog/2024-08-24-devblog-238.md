## Art events and new self-subscription role by @khannibal

Hello Velorians,

We are happy to announce the creation of a new role on our discord: @MeetingPingSquad. It will be used for the announcement of events and gatherings to avoid tagging everyone. In order to receive the role, go into ⁠[#rules-and-info](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/449650270096588810/1017410570040905819) on our discord and react to the user role message with the corresponding emoji (🧑‍🤝‍🧑 ).

A bimonthly art event will be announced soon after the release of this blog, so make sure to check it out on discord by selecting the @MeetingPingSquad! Participants of all skills are welcome, this will not be a contest, it will be a social event centered around voxel/pixel art! The goal is to help creativity by providing helpful feedback to our artists! Keep an eye for announcements!

Cheers!

## Airshipper Bug analysis by @xMAC94x

[We had a sequence of issues:](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/449650240350453760/1276206795643420753)

1. The update was timed right before the weekly build, which was in theory perfect. However I messed up the Port (it changed from 8000 -> 8080). I fixed that quick and dirty by adjusting the deployment.
2. The Webhook from gitlab ran, however our prune job deleted ALL but 1 ID, (we wanted all but 1 GROUP BY arch,os,channel ). Due to that people couldn't download the latest version. (there were around 10 people online at that time).
3. I corrected the Port in the meantime by adjusting the helm chart.
4. I retried the Webhook from gitlab's side, however there was a WARN without any further details that gitlab gave us an invalid json.
5. After enhancing the logs I could see that the message 401ed, as our token was invalid. I figured out that our token should be something different but didn't know why it was broken. I fixed that by manually setting the gitlab token. Now the code ran again, and I could trigger the webhook again.
6. I figured out the reason for the wrong token, a job in infrastructure repo is failing which caused `prod` to be not what `master` is. I manually overwrote that. I am going to check now if there is some token that needs to be rotated
7. Seemed a token got invalid which caused `prod` to not update to `master`
