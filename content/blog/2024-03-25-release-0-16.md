## 0.16 Release

Veloren is finally releasing 0.16! It has been 9 months since 0.15 was released so there has been a lot of work put into this version.

If you're reading this before <b>18:00 GMT on March 30th</b>, make sure to join the release party.
On the side, you can also watch the [release party dev
stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEcqoXXzDK4), where we'll be chatting
with devs about what went into this version.

To join, you can download the game for free at
[veloren.net](https://veloren.net/download) and [create an
account](https://veloren.net/account/), then launch the game and hop on the
default server. See you there!

We'll also be having a vote on discord for the new map to use for the official server in the coming days. Be sure to check that out!

### New in this release

Here are some of the changes in this release:

- New axe skill tree.
- Two new dungeons, haniwa catacombs and terracotta ruins.
- Some new structures: airship docs, taverns and desert arenas.
- We got a cool new mesa biome, where the mountain towns are built now.
- Caves got a really cool update, with new cave biomes, be sure to check them out!
- We are finally using a new wgpu version which allows people to run the game using OpenGl.
- Plugins have gotten updates and it's now supported for servers to have plugins which are shared with the client when joining.
- Map generation UI for singleplayer in voxygen.
- Many balancing changes.
- New models and shader changes so the low level of detail terrain will look a lot better.
- While gliding you can now encounter updrafts.
