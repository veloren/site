### Pet feeding by @aweinstock

To solve the problem of pets choosing not to pick up food (and having other NPCs take the food),
I added trade AI for pets. Pets only accept trade requests with their owner, only accept food,
and do not return food that they're given.

In the process of working with pet inventories to
ensure that they had the right amount of slots, I also fixed an issue where pets were not
supplied their intrinsic weapons and armour when reloaded on login (e.g. tortoises had
significantly lower defence after taming them and logging out and in).
