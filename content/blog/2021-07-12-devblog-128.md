This week, we get to see some progress on some new character variations. We also
learn about what changes are being made to modular weapons.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @xMAC94x, @Sam, @ubruntu, @tygyh,
@szabo_lambert, @a1phyr, @swrup, @knightresspaladin, @caldog20, @YuriMomo,
@Pfau, @zesterer, @juliancoffee@DixieDev, @Swagazaki, @Snowram, @aweinstock,
@XVar.

@Pfau is making his way back to working on the project. His first bigger
contribution was adding baldness as an option for the body type 1 of Danari and
humans. Also, there are now more horn variations for Danari And 10+ beard styles
for Danari. @Pfau also added a button to the map menu to toggle @aweinstock's
more detailed minimap mode.

### Modular weapons by @Sam

In preparation for modular weapons, I've added a few stats to weapons.

- Range: For melee attacks, this will obviously increase the range. For
  projectile-based attacks, this increases the projectile speed. For both
  shockwaves and beams, this increases the duration of the shockwave or beam
  segment.
- Energy efficiency: This reduces both the energy cost of activating an ability,
  and the rate at which energy drains for any abilities that have an energy
  drain.
- Buff strength: This will affect the power of buffs and debuffs inflicted in
  attacks. We are also considering having buff strength affect the strength of
  buffs applied by auras instead of power.

A few weeks ago, we also had a meeting on working out some of the specifics for
modular weapons. The details from that meeting were made into an RFC and can be
found
[here](https://gitlab.com/veloren/rfcs/-/blob/master/open/0021-modular-weapons.md).
