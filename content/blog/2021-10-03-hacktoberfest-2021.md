## Hacktoberfest 2021

Veloren will be participating in [Hacktoberfest
2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)! This will be an opportunity to
get more developers started on the project, and help them along the way. Also,
you get a cool t-shirt if you make 4 separate pull requests!

### What is Hacktoberfest?

*From the website:*

Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source
software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join
open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by
contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
- Organize an event
- Mentor others
- Donate directly to open source projects

### How do I get started?

First of all, [register on the Hacktoberfest
website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register). You'll need to sign
up with GitLab (and GitHub as well if you like), since all pull requests are
done through GitLab.

Next, hop into our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ecUxc9N), and go to the #hacktoberfest channel. Here, you can ask for help to get started. We'll get you
set up with contributing, and help you find [an issue with the Hacktoberfest
tag](https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren/-/issues?label_name=hacktoberfest). As
you're working on it, core developers will be on hand to help you understand what you
need. Feel free to ask for help!

We hope that this will help new contributors get started on the project, and
help improve their Rust skills.
