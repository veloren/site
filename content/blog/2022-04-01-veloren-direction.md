## Veloren's New Direction

Since Veloren's inception, people have seen Veloren as heavily inspired by Cube
World. Today, we're excited to fully break away from this lineage as we announce
the new direction of the project: **Need for Voxels: Veloren Cart**.

Market research shows that the most potential for a voxel game is in the casual
gaming market. That means games that can be played for a quick 15-30 minute
session and put down afterward. However, role-playing games, which are
grinding-focused, do not fit so well into this category. Therefore, we decided to pivot
the core mechanics to focus on racing.

This change will give you the opportunity to join the new world of **Need for
Voxels: Veloren Cart** in a race with up to 2,000 players through the places you
love: gigantic cities, scary dungeons, and on a moving airship! Not only this,
but we'll be able to re-use many of our models from Veloren, so you'll be able
to race while riding horses, fish, and spiders. The planned release date will be
in exactly one year, on **2023-04-01**.
