## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @xMAC94x, @JakobDev, @James, @Sam, and
@Tormod!

Last weekend, Veloren participated in Reddit's /r/place project. Veloren was
able to get a spot on the map by allying with /r/Rust and building beside them.
A template was created so that everyone in the area could know what colours to
place, which made it easy to protect the area. It was a lot of fun, and we got a
pretty great result eternalized in the final image (before the destruction of
the whole map ðŸ˜›).

### Veloren Reading Club #7 by @aweinstock

This week, another Veloren Reading Club was held! The topic was profiling
Veloren with the [Tracy profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy).

As a supplement to the talk, here are some commands to follow along and try
Tracy yourself:

Compiling and running Tracy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy
cd tracy
git checkout tags/v0.7.8 -b tags_v0.7.8
cd profiler/build/unix
make
./Tracy-release
```

Compiling and running Veloren with Tracy support:

```bash
cargo run --features=tracy --bin veloren-server-cli
cargo run --features=tracy --bin veloren-voxygen
```

Running Veloren's "swarm" client (requires running the server with --no-auth
  and making swarm0 an admin):

```bash
cargo run --features='bin_bot tick_network' --bin swarm
```
