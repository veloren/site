This week we prepare for the 0.7 release. With the code freeze, we don't have
too many new features to talk about, but we get a rundown on particle timing
from @lobster.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @yusdacra, @Songtronix, @scottc, @Imbris,
@IBotDEU, @Slipped, @nepo, @zesterer, @Pfau, @xMAC94x, @Varpie, @Sharp,
@AngelOnFira, @Sam, @Silentium, @BottledByte, and @JudgeGriesa!

0.7: "The Progression Update" is releasing this weekend! In this version, many
changes have been made to combat, animations, worldgen, and a lot more systems.
The release party will be happening this Saturday at 18:00 GMT+0. Come join us
on the main server to check out all the new changes!

@nepo added Dullahan into the game with help from @Slipped and @Snowram. The
model was created by @Gemu. @lobster wrote a basic scheduler for particles, so
we have emitter-like functionality. @PlaneCat has been working on adding a
weapons guide to the book. @Slipped merged swimming improvements including
controlling and animations. @zesterer added @WelshPixie's furniture models into
the game.

## Particle Timing by @lobster

Since we got rid of our ECS particle emitter component, we also lost our timing
mechanism to generate particles at the correct time. Which means our particle
spawn rate is now tied to the framerate. So if the frame rate stutters, it can
cause changes in particle density or other weird visual artifacts.

To fix this we need to track the last time a particle was created for any given
effect, so we can have consistent timing between particles. And because we have
a lot of particles, reducing the work done per-particle is important because it's
multiplied 10,000 times or more, which can have a big performance impact.

Since many particles are generated using the same or similar timings, we can
optimise this by putting all particles that spawn at the same rate into
frequency buckets. So now instead of tracking last created time for a single
particle, we can do it per frequency.

```rs
for _ in 0..self.scheduler.heartbeats(Duration::from_millis(10)) {
    // spawn a smoke particle
}

// ...

/// Accumulates heartbeats to be consumed on the next tick.
struct HeartbeatScheduler {
    /// Duration = Heartbeat Frequency/Intervals
    /// Instant = Last update time
    /// u8 = number of heartbeats since last update
    /// - if it's more frequent then tick rate, it could be 1 or more.
    /// - if it's less frequent then tick rate, it could be 1 or 0.
    /// - if it's equal to the tick rate, it could be between 2 and 0, due to
    /// delta time variance etc.
    timers: HashMap<Duration, (Instant, u8)>,
}

impl HeartbeatScheduler {
    /// updates the last elapsed times and elasped counts
    /// this should be called once, and only once per tick.
    pub fn maintain(&mut self) {
        for (frequency, (last_update, heartbeats)) in self.timers.iter_mut() {
            // the number of frequency cycles that have occurred.
            *heartbeats =
                (last_update.elapsed().as_secs_f32() / frequency.as_secs_f32()).floor() as u8;

            // Note: we want to preserve incomplete heartbeats, and roll them
            // over into the next tick.
            *last_update += frequency.mul_f32(*heartbeats as f32);
            // alternatively expressed as: now - remaining_partial_heartbeat_time
        }
    }

    /// returns the number of times this duration has elasped since the last
    /// tick:
    /// - if it's more frequent then tick rate, it could be 1 or more.
    /// - if it's less frequent then tick rate, it could be 1 or 0.
    /// - if it's equal to the tick rate, it could be between 2 and 0, due to
    /// delta time variance.
    pub fn heartbeats(&mut self, frequency: Duration) -> u8 {
        self.timers
            .entry(frequency)
            .or_insert_with(|| (Instant::now(), 0))
            .1
    }
}
```

Another advantage to this approach is now we now have a larger and more
consistent batch of particles that can further avoid memory fragmentation (dead
particles wasting memory) by grouping even more particles with the same lifespan
together. They can then be more efficiently arranged and uploaded to GPU, by taking
advantage of bulk operations such as replacing an entire slice of memory with
another set of particles.

But the downside to this approach is that all effects with the same frequency
will be in sync and might look weird on the screen. But this is not an issue for
effects that have a fast particle spawn frequency, because it's imperceptible to
most humans. But for particles that have slow spawn rates, such as 100ms and
above, it starts to become noticeable.
