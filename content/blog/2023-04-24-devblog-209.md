## Airship furniture by @Isse

In [TWIV 206](https://veloren.net/devblog-206/) you might have noticed an airship with a set of chairs on it. That's something I've been developing on and off the last couple of months. The goal is to be able to give more detail to airships and boats using sprites (which can be furniture, doors, ropes). This also makes voxygen handles voxel colliders a lot more like normal terrain, where you can interact with some blocks, other blocks give off particles or even sounds (sounds are yet to be implemented).

With this feature I've also implemented a way to mount a few sprites, like chairs or a helm which lets you control the vehicle. This makes riding an airship much more seamless as you don't have to worry about falling off.
