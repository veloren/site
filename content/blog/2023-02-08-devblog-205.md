### Potion shops were created during a two week internship by @nixda

In my two-week internship about game-design, I learned a lot about the different aspects and tasks that come with it.
I was always interested in programming and I always wanted to contribute to a game, which now I did.
Around 1 month before the Internship started, I started learning the basics of Rust.
In my first week, I learned a lot about what comes with game-design, for example economy or how the code of Veloren is structured and where to find things etcâ€¦
In the second week I build my own random generated "house" using site2.
