This week, we learn about some proposed changes to how Airshipper downloads
updated assets. We also learn about some changes coming to jewelry.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Sam, @ubruntu, @xMAC94x, @nwildner,
@Slipped, @UncomfySilence, @zesterer, @MHK.2012, @kaedr, @Socksonme, @KaliKatz,
@Sharp, and @imbris!

@zesterer reworked the aurora shaders (along with how lighting at night is
handled). You can see the results below. You can read this week's meeting notes

### Asset downloads by @Christof

Motivated by the network speed issues with Airshipper, I recently made a
proposal for incremental downloads of the game. See the discussion in [this
thread](https://discord.com/channels/449602562165833758/897605984837595206/897606117818007592)
for more details. Basically, this proposal will send the checksum of all the
files to Airshipper which will download only missing and updated parts of the
archive - using either individual file sub-archives or full directories as
needed. These sub-archives can be generated from a complete archive, on the fly
by a cheap server-side logic, and are fully cacheable. The assets are even
identical across architectures.

Also, I found that of the 200MB distribution file only 66MB are taken by the
daily changing binaries, the rest is typically unchanged. Further investigation
showed that the 66MB for `veloren-server-cli.exe` and `veloren-voxygen.exe` can
shrink to 40MB by using a [more efficient
compression](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel-Ziv-Markow-Algorithmus) (aka
.lzma or .xz) instead of [deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) (aka
.gz or zlib). Typically we might avoid this less portable compression method in
zip files, if the archive was meant to be extracted by a different program than
Airshipper. In Airshipper, we can bundle
[lzma-rs](https://lib.rs/crates/lzma-rs) to decompress this format (which is
also supported by 7-Zip and newer WinZip versions).

### Sneaking by @ubruntu

This week, I refactored character states a bit so that sneaking isn't its own
distinct state in the `CharacterState` enum, but rather it's an attribute of the
"idle" state. The wielding and equipping states also got a stealth variety, and
the end result is that players can pull out their weapons while sneaking. Shout
out to @Slipped for doing all the animation work.

### Jewelry changes by @DoctorKompot

Recently, I've been working on an update for jewelry. Existing rings are being
reworked and some new necklaces are getting added.
