These weeks, we look at arena, windmill and phoenix work.

\- Christof, TWiV editor

## Contributor Work

Thanks to last three weeks' contributors @lle-bout, @Christof, @imbris, @crabman and @Nectical, @xMAC94x, @Gaxrodi, @tygyh, many contributors in Codeberg WebLate, @walpo, @vasco, @namolite, Thomas S, @Isse, @Qsto and @floppy, @xiretza, @Neras.

The merged work includes a network library update, locations in character selection, a winit (OS window) update, a new portal graphic, dependency update, many translation updates, a README update, rtsim airship fixes, loot balancing, buff death message improvements, and group chat fixes.

Ongoing (unmerged) work is happening on Phoenix abilities, NPC arena üèüÔ∏è, Frost Giga attacks, a compass, bank storage, windmills, CI scripts, saving window size, singleplayer world selection, lava material, and weather network optimization.

## Reviewing merge requests

Although the amount of merge requests merged increased in August
after a low in June, there are still plenty of them open.
So we encourage everyone to participate in reviews, a gitlab account is all
you need to start. Alternatively you can join the discussion in the
Discord thread linked from the MR.

If you want to learn more about how swarm reviews can work
for open source projects, look at Alice's excellent
[blog post](https://www.leafwing-studios.com/blog/triage-by-controversy/)
