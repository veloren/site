@ubruntu has been working on bank storage, which is a separate inventory that
players will be able to access in towns to store excess items. Credit goes to
@Toaster for the sprite model.

There was also another Veloren Code Review stream. In this episode, @Sam brought
us through a merge request about how damage numbers show on screen.

### Arthropods and the Harvester @UncomfySilence

I've made a small balance tweaks branch which touches upon a couple of things
that weren't quite right nor was I happy with.

As part of this, I've finally rebalanced arthropods, so the long pain in finally
over. It took considerably longer than expected due to multiple things so I'm
incredibly sorry for the wait. I also ended up changing the stats for most hats
so that they're better befitting of their rank alongside more specialized stats,
so I'd suggest checking them out and comparing!

I've also adjusted the stats of the Harvester so that it has roughly the same
difficulty as a T4 boss. To hinder even more feature creep I am planning on
making another MR which will give the Harvester a new set of skills to make sure
that it's as threatening as possible.
