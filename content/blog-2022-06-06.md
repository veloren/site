This week, we hear about an issue with memory leaking somewhere in the memory
pipeline.

## Veloren memory leak by @YuriMomo

This week, @YuriMomo found a memory leak in the Veloren.

As we can see, Veloren is taking up significantly more RAM than it should.
@YuriMomo dove deeper into the problem to diagnose it. They found that something
was constantly allocating 32 bytes each frame, which added up over time.

}}

Although this memory would be freed just fine after the game closes, it's
clearly living for longer than it should. Ideally, it should be cleaned up after
each frame. A little more analysis lead to discovering this code:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn wgpu_render_pass_push_debug_group(
    pass: &mut RenderPass,
    label: RawString,
    color: u32,
) {
    let bytes = ffi::CStr::from_ptr(label).to_bytes();
    pass.base.string_data.extend_from_slice(bytes);

    pass.base.commands.push(RenderCommand::PushDebugGroup {
        color,
        len: bytes.len(),
    });
}
```

Which was passing information from Veloren to wgpu, the rendering API that
Veloren uses. Some more diagnostics were run, and @imbris mentioned that the
problem seemed to be deeper than what we have access to through just the wgpu API.

}}

This issue still has not been fully resolved, but more people on the team are
looking into parts of it. More to come in the future!
