## Scrolling combat text by @Socksonme

For the past couple of months, I've been working on a rewrite of the SCT system
that we have. (These are the damage numbers that show up on the screen - both
for the player and the enemies). The old method that was used for creating the
"floaters" had many issues. First, it checked if the health had changed in the
last frame, and second, it only used the last change applied to the health. The
way that the check was made was by storing the hp on the current tick, and then
on the next tick - comparing them to see if they're different.

The issue that this caused was that an equal amount of healing and damage done
in the same tick would lead to no damage numbers being shown. The second issue,
which is displaying only the last change, led to some attacks/weapons showing
incorrect damage. For example - the bow's "Shotgun" attack, the slashing damage
from the sword, whenever the enemy doesn't have enough energy left, or the poise
damage, whenever the enemy is stunned. All of these attacks apply multiple
changes to the health, in the same tick, which would obviously cause an issue.

}}

The new system put in place now uses "outcomes", which are the result of an
event. Whenever an attack is applied, a `HealthChange` server event is emitted.
This is then handled and then a `HealthChange` outcome is emitted. Then, for
every `HealthChange` outcome, we go through some new conditions in order to see
how some health changes should be displayed. Before the `HealthChange` server
event is emitted, a random number is generated and then stored, since we will
want to group up damage from the same attack (I will explain why later).

Another value that is now stored is the crit boolean, which, as the name
suggests, stores whether a health change was a crit or not. Crits dealt to an
enemy are separated from regular attacks, and they themselves aren't accumulated
with other crits. They are also displayed in a random position left or right
from where the regular attacks show up. They are a bit larger than the damage
numbers for regular attacks and have a yellow color.

In comparison to the floaters for the enemies, crits and regular attacks are
shown in the same position for the player, and are accumulated normally,
however, they still possess a yellow color. I decided to also let the player
decide the duration for which floaters should be accumulated. This is done by
having two separate sliders going from 0.0 seconds to 2.0 seconds (one for
damage dealt by the player and one for damage dealt to the player).

However, this poses another small issue, which is that, if you have damage from
the same attack happening in the same tick, while you have the damage
accumulation duration set to 0 seconds, this would lead to the text being
unreadable. As a method to solve this, as I mentioned before, we check if this
random number (which is the same for damage from the same attack) is the same,
and also if it's from the same tick, and if so - accumulate the damage.

Some minor changes also include: having a toggleable option for rounding damage
which is greater than or equal to 1.0, having an option for experience number
accumulation (I decided that having a slider for the duration would be
excessive) and some sources of damage/healing - for example, fall damage,
campfires, food, the regeneration buff, and others, now show up in the SCT.
Also, since we now have a slider for the accumulation duration, I felt that I
should remove both the single and cumulated damage options. (might post some
images later)
