Veloren is releasing 0.13! This version is 5 months in the making, and we have a
lot to show off!

23rd](https://everytimezone.com/s/020e183f), make sure to join the release
party. There will be a custom pirate-themed map with plenty of secrets to find (
thanks to @Hannibal ), minigames, and other events so don't miss it and make
sure to bring your friends along! 🏴‍☠️ Explore the handcrafted jungle isles to
seek the treasures of the Sunken Duchess!
