This week, we watch a certain jumping plumber.

\- Christof, TWiV Contributor

# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @xMAC94x, @fanix472, @aweinstock, @juliancoffee, @meyerhenning, @ztianyang.

## Tracking issues in the book by @zesterer

I added a page to the book that lists all of the currently open tracking issues. I hope this will act as a useful resource for contributors looking to work on things, and hopefully it'll encourage us to improve the quality of our [tracking issues](https://book.veloren.net/contributors/tracking-issues.html#tracking-issues)!

See also [this week's developer meeting minutes](https://hackmd.io/DxpRFzx6Rxav81DDg8ltSA) for more details.

## Super Veloren 64

Also @zesterer created a cool tech demo because he "was bored today":

## Translation changes by @Juliancoffee

Me and @xMAC94x made some changes to how chat is translated and introduced the new i18n-helpers crate. For the time being it lies in voxygen workspace.
It enables third-party clients to use localisation (and translations, if desired) via the client/i18n subcrate.

And with that we now have the possibility to work on more complex translations, like character names and items. 
Until that point, we could translate mostly GUI only (+ some npc messages).
If you want to work on it, ping me @juliancoffee in #new-contributors
