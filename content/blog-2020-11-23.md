# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @zesterer, @Christof, @Snowram, @Treeco,
@imbris, @Pfau, @Sam, @Knarkzel, @ubruntu, @xMAC94x, @James, @Slipped, and
@XVar!

This week, @Knarkzel fixed an issue with campfires and other entities
duplicating. @Snowram worked on changing dungeon spawns and layouts depending on
their level. @Songtronix put a lot of work into Airshipper, releasing 0.4.1.
@Christof added cave entrance icons and and names to the map. @zesterer merged
the worldsim branch after long last. He also added voxel lighting so that
certain blocks can emit to the area surrounding them. You can now see in towns
at night!

@Sam worked on some backend changes to how loadouts are built to make assigning
a weapon less hacky and to allow armor to be better specified. @Pfau, @Treeco,
and @zesterer added a lot
of UI map functions.
