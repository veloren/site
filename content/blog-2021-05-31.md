This week was Veloren's 3rd birthday! We are getting ready for the 0.10 release
coming in two weeks.

\- AngelOnFira, TWiV Editor

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Sam, @Adam, @ygor.souza, @xMAC94x,
@aweinstock, @Pfau, @Slipped, @juliancoffee, and @tygyh!

Veloren turned 3 last week! The day varies, whether you base it on the [day that
the idea was
suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/8m079o/cloning_cube_world_not_as_hard_as_you_may_think/)
(the 25th),
or the day the name "Veloren" was chosen (the 28th). Either way, happy birthday to the project!

You can read this week's meeting notes
[here](https://hackmd.io/0ccNtrS8RJuoGI2P68Xrww).

@Songtronix open sourced the [Veloren testing
bot](https://github.com/Songtronix/veloren-server-bot). He's also working
on a
crate to facilitate airshipper 0.5 featuring automatic retries, exponential
backoff, and an easy way to introduce file-based updates for anyone writing a
launcher in Rust. It will be fully async and based on Streams.

@Snowram added material tags to armor to help with the big progression MR,
also added 3 new troll variants with models by @Gemu.

### 0.10 release schedule

Veloren will release 0.10 on June 12th at 18:00 GMT+0. This means that over the
next couple of weeks, we'll be tying down loose ends of features, and going into
code freeze. Here is the planned schedule:

```

2021-06-08 18:00:00 GMT+0 Public Stability Testing with many people
2021-06-11 16:00:00 GMT+0 Fixes freeze - Nothing will be merged except game-breaking fixes
2021-06-12 09:00:00 GMT+0 Final Build

### Bugfixes by @aweinstock

I fixed a bug with the economy where data from the economic simulation wasn't
properly being converted to in-game prices, resulting in most towns having the
same prices for many kinds of goods.

I also implemented PID controllers to allow the AI to control airship buoyancy
properly (resulting in less intense acceleration), as well as fixed an issue in
collision resolution where players would collide with where an airship was in
the previous frame. Both of these fixes should make airships more robust to
stand on without falling through them.
