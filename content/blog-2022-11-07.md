## Doors by @aweinstock

Opening doors were merged this week.

For now doors open consistently in one direction defined by the world orientation, 
because responding to a direction they get pushed in would require adding internal state to sprites.

## Train tracks by @aweinstock

Tracks are disabled by default and can be enabled in assets/world/features.ron. Train stations and (later) trains are still under progress. 

Getting the lighting correct on the tracks made this work more complicated.
