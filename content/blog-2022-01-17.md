This week, we hear about many small changes to the renderer, the agent system,
skiing, inventories, and anthropods. We also hear about how the development of
the new mount system is progressing.

# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @flo, @zesterer, @unvariant, @imbris,
@Maveth1, @JakobDev, @Slipped, @Kember, @Sam, @terrarier2111, @Isse, @Pfau,
@Yurimomo, and @Tormod!

@Capucho has gotten Veloren working with WGPU and OpenGL! Right now, we're able
to use WGPU with Vulkan, however, this meant that older GPUs that couldn't run
Vulkan couldn't run Veloren. This is a step towards some more backward
compatibility.

@James broke up the monolithic agent system into several modules that will
hopefully make it easier to work with. @Christof got skiing and ice skating into
a playable state and made a video:

@tormeh made item shortcuts in the hotbar independent of inventory sort, so you
can sort your possessions without losing the hotkey for your potions. @Snowram
added a new skeleton to the game; the arthropod. Here is the new batch of
creatures you will encounter soon...

## Mounts by @zesterer

I've been working with @Slipped on getting mounts ready for players.

We did already have a mounting system, but it was weird, arcane, and
fundamentally broken in a variety of ways. It integrated very poorly with the
rest of the game and was full of bugs. For this reason, it wasn't player-facing:
only admin-spawned entities could be mounted.

This week, that all changed! I finally had the time to sit down and rewrite the
entire mounting system from the ground up. It's now very reliable, has fewer
bugs (although there may still be some: please report them!), and has more
features. New features include:

- New jumping/mounting animations (thanks @Slipped)
- Interaction hints when close to entities (talk, trade, mount, pick up, etc.)
- Mounted combat: you can use weapons while mounted, to a limited degree
  (certain moves are disabled for now)
- Teleporting while mounted now works. You can use /home while riding a mount!

@Slipped gives a shoutout to @Snowram and @imbris too for setting up the mounted
animation some months back, which now gets to be used.
