This week, we see some work on translation, as well as where towers are headed.

# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @KnightressPaladin, @Pfau, @xMAC94x,
@zesterer, @tygyh, @imbris, @lboklin, @Capucho, @Snowram, @mohs8421,
@juliancoffee, @XVar, @kilpkonn, @AngelOnFira, @aweinstock, @Fxsch, and
@Fungoid!

@juliancoffee has been working on a PvP and PvE server switch. @Dr.Dystopia
spent the week extracting methods across the codebase. @xMAC94x has been working
on translation cleanups, with a unique translation scheme. These improvements
have also increased the translation test times by 4x. Work was also done to get
this information into Grafana, which can be seen below.

## @aweinstock

I've been working on towers (aboveground dungeons, intended to be populated with
things like mages and golems and animated books).

In the process, I found that site2 structure blitting accidentally had quadratic
runtime complexity. Generation of each chunk was trying to iterate over each
primitive in the structure, instead of only the intersection of those primitives
with the chunk. This fix was merged ahead of the rest of towers, and makes
dungeons load faster.
