@Yusdacra packaged Airshipper for NixOS and implemented NixOS-specific
executable patching, so now it can be used on NixOS without Flatpak. Currently,
these changes are on the staging branch of Airshipper repository.

@R.A.B added a chat tab system. It allows players to select filters for
different tabs of the chat. @holychowders  got NPCs to hear and respond to
sounds.

## Minimap by @aweinstock

This week, I added a minimap mode where voxel terrain data is visible on the
minimap. For each loaded chunk with some radius of the player, it builds a map
of what's visible looking downwards from each z-level. It uses the maps to
efficiently build a composite image of the currently loaded chunks from the
ceiling above the player, in a manner that works nicely with dungeons, caves,
and houses.

}}

I also fixed the mindflayer AI so it can summon minions at HP thresholds again,
and added a purple fireball attack that it uses when the player is out of range.
