This week has had another big push on the refactoring front. Also, big strides will be coming to the netcode soon!

## Programming
@zesterer took the time to do a Q&A to answer lots of engine questions for the programmers. Since the Discord server is seeing multiple potential programmers join each week, we need to make sure to get them up and running as quickly as possible.

@Mckol is on winter break and is ready to put a heavy two weeks into Veloren’s netcode. He’s been quite busy in the Discord this week getting input from lots of programmers on certain topics in the domain.

## Art

Lots of voxel concept art has been thrown around in #voxel-art. We are trying to post some of this content to Twitter periodically, so be sure to [follow us](https://twitter.com/velorenproject) if you haven’t already.
