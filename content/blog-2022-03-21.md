# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @XVar, @xMAC94x, @holychowders,
@AndrzejDrabarek, @Christof, @imbris, @James, @Mehmet-dev, @Mel!

@batvin123 got crafty, and put the Linux, Windows, and MacOS versions of the
launcher for Veloren on a cd-r. Now they can play the game like they were back
in the early 2000s or 90s!

## Modular weapon tooltips by @ubruntu

I worked on tooltips for modular weapon components. Not all the models are in
yet and the numbers need balancing, but now they display new stats. Also, the
item-kind text (e.g. 'Firestaff Component' in this example) is dynamically
generated and i18n friendly.

Back in November of 2021, Veloren spoke at Rust in Arts with a "Director's
Commentary" of the game. The talk was just released on YouTube, and you can
[watch it
