This week, we see how some of the combat animations are improving. @zesterer
gives us an in-depth look into the new and improved cloud system.

# Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Slipped, @xMAC94x, @jiminycrick, @Snowram,
@UMR1352, @Sam, @zesterer, and @imbris!

@James has continued work on new attacks for the bow and axe. There is a new M1
combo for the axe, but it hasn't been merged just yet. @Sam and @imbris worked
on the buff system that was started by @BottledByte over a month ago. It's
almost ready to merge! @Namp007 contributed Dutch translations, which are on
their way to being merged.

}}

@James is also working on biome specific soundtracks. They were recently made
possible along with separating ambient sounds from music. However, this probably
won't be merged to master for a while until we have decided on a way to blend
between biomes and have it work more efficiently.

# Cloud Improvements by @zesterer

In current nightly builds of Veloren, we have clouds. I introduced clouds almost
a year ago, to mixed responses. Although most people enjoy the more 'realistic'
clouds that the game has, a common complaint is that they don't fit the voxel
style of the game so well.

Although I appreciate and understand this perspective, I personally believe that
the core reason for this nervousness about clouds lies in the uncanny way they
look. It's clear that we aim for realism, but they often fall short. I'm also
determined to see clouds take a bigger role in Veloren's atmospheric look and
feel.

There are a few reasons for this:

- Our current technique uses an optimised form of raymarching that only works
  within a very narrow plane. As a result, clouds often appear as a thin layer
  to players close to the ground.
- The lighting and shader overhaul a few months ago 'broke' their appearance
  because much of the existing code fudged physical properties with magic
  constants in a rather unprincipled way.
- Clouds don't have effect lighting. This means that they feel disconnected from
  the world; a backdrop to fill space in the sky rather than an interactive part
  of the world.

I felt it was time to resolve this situation. First and foremost it gave me an
excuse to put off more pressing work refactoring and improving the world
generation and simulation code, but it also provided an opportunity for me to
revisit the clouds (I've always felt that they don't live up to their
potential).

I started by adapting the existing code. I figured that it might be possible to
enhance the shaders by playing with magic constants until something that looked
better appeared. I did have a little luck with this, as shown below.

These new clouds still didn't solve the underlying problems, however. I put
things to the side for about 2 months.

Last week, I came back to them. I decided to almost entirely rewrite the ray
marching code. Where previously we calculated very narrow bounds within which
ray marching occurred, I removed those bounds and allowed rays to sample the
entire sky. However, it quickly became clear that this was too expensive to be
viable in the long term.

To alleviate the issue, I began experimenting with ways to more cheaply compute
the procedural noise required to create the cloud density field. I found that
with a few careful tricks I could tease shapes that felt realistic out of the
code with just a fraction of the cost of the previous cloud code. I also
discovered a very cheap way to compute low quality 3D noise several times faster
than conventional techniques for generating noise in shaders using a small tiled
2D monochromatic texture and some careful interpolation.

The next thing I did was to move the location that cloud shaders were applied.
On current nightly builds, cloud shading is computed in the fragment shader for
all models (sprites, figures, terrain, LoD, the skybox, etc.). Although we've
been careful to optimise our draw order as much as possible, overlapping
fragments still meant that we were calculating cloud shading for fragments that
simply didn't get shown on the screen.

To alleviate this, I moved cloud shading to the post-processing shader by
extracting the depth buffer and using it as a texture input. I then used the
inverse view/projection matrices, along with the depth from the depth buffer, to
reconstruct the world position for each fragment (thanks to @Sharp for helping
me fix a persistent bug along the way). I could then do cloud shading on only
fragments that appear on the screen.

With these techniques, combined with a few extra mathematical shortcuts, I was
able to make 'floor-to-ceiling' cloud tracing viable. Here are the results:

}}

I still wasn't happy with it. Although having clouds appear at multiple z levels
was a serious improvement on what was there before, I still felt that they
didn't look appropriately realistic. To alleviate this, I ended up tearing up
most of the raymarching code to rewrite it in a way that more closely mirrored
how light scattering occurred in real life.

Although it's not a perfect representation of reality (a lot of calculations are
still rough approximations of physical parameters), the end results speak for
themselves. The new code...

- Uses the trapezium rule to approximate the integration of cloud density with
  respect to distance over the course of projected rays
- Includes a (poor) approximation of rayleigh scattering, making distant objects
  appear much further away than they looked before
- Has multiple graphical settings: None, Minimal, Low, Medium, and High. Minimal
  clouds should be fast enough for almost any hardware.
- Tracks cloud shadows on terrain; skies can look overcast now!
- Incorporates moving mist
- Performs significantly better than the currently nightly's cloud code on lower
  settings

Since clouds are now shaded in a (more) physically accurate way, they also
continue to look good under differing environmental conditions. No hackery was
required to make them look good during sunrise, sunset, or night: the results
just fall out as a natural consequence of calculating them in a more accurate
way!

The new clouds are not yet on the latest nightly build. There are still a few
minor issues to address and it has not yet been fully reviewed. With any luck,
they should be landing in the game within the next week or so.
