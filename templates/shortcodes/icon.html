The advantage is that inline SVGs can be manipulated by CSS, unlike external ones.
The macro requires the path to point to a file in a local directory and have the `.svg` file extension. #}
{% if path is not ending_with(".svg") %}
  {{ throw(message="File extension is not .svg!") }}
{% endif %}
{{ load_data(path=path) | safe }}
